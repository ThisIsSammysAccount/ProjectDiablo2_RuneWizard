Project Diablo 2 RuneWizard
===========================

This is intended as a free resource for Project Diablo 2 players.

The "rune wizard" is an interactive page (javascript) which remembers which runes you have found and lets you easily see all the Runewords that can be completed, as well as the Runewords properties. The original Diablo 2 rune wizard has been updated to work with the Project Diablo 2 mod.
